# Sample SSEvent
The idea here is only to show that you can generate events from the backend and push them to the frontend. The code in here is not "Fancy" and is there only for the sole purpose of a demo.

# Pre-requisite
- .Net 5.0 (Built using that, but you could also use dotnet3.1)

# How to start
Simply run the following command:

```sh
dotnet run
```
